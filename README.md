# Summary
This is a simple webcrawler that performs deep crawling into urls from the main urls that are provided by the user to retrieve information from the top 15 urls that were crawled. This application is build mainly using the concept of multi-threading which allow tasks (two main urls given) to run concurrently within a single program. Jsoup, an open-source java library is used to parse, extract, manipulate the data that are found in the html documents.
